Subject: Q3 Feedback & Summary of My Contributions

Hi Sahil,

I wanted to document my contributions for clear visibility and discussion.
	•	In UAT, I handled testing for all listed domains individually, even when other domains had team support.
	•	Apart from UAT, I actively contributed to SRs, CP bugs, and the development of common functionalities.
	•	Developed Tranche 2 SSOPS SR and worked closely with Sugan and Arul, helping them with a ground-level understanding.
	•	Supported the implementation of a CR in RD Recon for Sheetal.
	•	Assisted the TW team with RD, CSD Project Ghana, and worked on a major change for PAK Aasan Installment, which is pending file review.
	•	Worked as a Full Stack Developer, handling both frontend and backend responsibilities, while others in the same role focused individually on either frontend or backend.
	•	Collaborated with the team whenever required and contributed wherever needed.

I would also appreciate your input on any initiatives taken by other team members where I can contribute. Additionally, if you have any other feedback, including for Q3, feel free to share.

Best,
[Your Name]
