Subject: Q3 Feedback & Summary of My Contributions

Hi Sahil,

I wanted to document my contributions for clear visibility and discussion, ensuring my efforts align with team and organizational goals.
	•	In UAT, I handled testing for all listed domains individually, even when other domains had dedicated team support.
	•	Beyond UAT, I actively contributed to SRs, CP bugs, and the development of common functionalities, ensuring smoother application performance.
	•	Developed Tranche 2 SSOPS SR and collaborated with Sugan and Arul, helping them with a ground-level understanding and knowledge sharing.
	•	Supported the implementation of a CR in RD Recon for Sheetal, ensuring successful integration.
	•	Assisted the TW team with RD, CSD Project Ghana, and worked on a major change for PAK Aasan Installment, which is pending file review.
	•	Worked as a Full Stack Developer, efficiently managing both frontend and backend responsibilities, whereas others in the same role focused individually on either frontend or backend.
	•	Took ownership of critical modules, ensuring high-quality deliveries while mentoring and supporting the team whenever required.
	•	Proactively identified gaps and potential improvements in the system, contributing to enhanced efficiency and performance.
	•	Always ready to collaborate, assist, and take on additional responsibilities, reinforcing a leadership mindset within the team.

I would also appreciate your input on any initiatives taken by other team members where I can contribute. Additionally, if you have any other feedback, including for Q3, please feel free to share.

Looking forward to your guidance on how I can further align myself for greater responsibilities and growth within the organization.

Best,

I understand you want to handle a disconnect scenario (like browser closing) where you need to:

	1.	Trigger an API call to unlock a case
	2.	Handle this in a disconnected callback
	3.	Possibly redirect to a different button/page

Here’s a sample implementation in JavaScript (assuming you’re using WebSocket or similar connection with Lit framework):

import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';

// Custom element class
class MyComponent extends LitElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.handleDisconnect = this.handleDisconnect.bind(this);
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    // Add event listeners when component connects
    window.addEventListener('beforeunload', this.handleDisconnect);
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    super.disconnectedCallback();
    // Clean up event listeners and handle disconnect
    this.handleDisconnect();
    window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', this.handleDisconnect);
  }

  async handleDisconnect() {
    try {
      // API call to unlock case
      await this.unlockCase();
      // Navigate to different button/page after unlock
      this.navigateToDifferentButton();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error in disconnect handling:', error);
    }
  }

  async unlockCase() {
    // Your API call to unlock the case
    const response = await fetch('your-api-endpoint/unlock', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        caseId: this.caseId // Assuming you have caseId stored somewhere
      })
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to unlock case');
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  }

  navigateToDifferentButton() {
    // Navigation logic - could be:
    // 1. Using window.location
    window.location.href = '/different-button-page';
    
    // OR 2. Dispatching a custom event if using a router
    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('navigate', {
      detail: { path: '/different-button' },
      bubbles: true,
      composed: true
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <button @click=${() => this.someAction()}>Some Button</button>
    `;
  }
}

// Define the custom element
customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);

For a more basic implementation without Lit:

// Global disconnect handler
async function handleDisconnect() {
  try {
    await unlockCase();
    window.location.href = '/different-button-page';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Unlock failed:', error);
  }
}

// Unlock case API call
async function unlockCase() {
  const response = await fetch('your-api-endpoint/unlock', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      caseId: 'your-case-id'
    })
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Unlock failed');
  }
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Add event listeners
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
  // Note: Modern browsers limit what you can do in beforeunload
  handleDisconnect();
});

// Optional: Handle manual disconnect
document.getElementById('someButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  handleDisconnect();
});

Key points about this implementation:

	1.	The beforeunload event catches browser closing scenarios
	2.	disconnectedCallback in Lit handles component unmounting
	3.	The unlock API call is made before navigation
	4.	Error handling is included
	5.	Navigation happens after successful unlock

Important notes:

	•	Replace 'your-api-endpoint/unlock' with your actual API endpoint
	•	Add proper authentication if required
	•	Store and pass the actual caseId
	•	Modern browsers may restrict async operations in beforeunload
	•	For reliable disconnect handling, you might want to:
	•	Use WebSocket with a proper close handler
	•	Implement a heartbeat mechanism
	•	Use session management on the server

Would you like me to modify this for a specific framework or add more details to any part?
