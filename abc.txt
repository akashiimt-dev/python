Subject: Request for Discussion on 2024 Year-End Review

Hi Sahil,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly share that since joining the bank nearly two years ago, I haven’t received an increment, which is a first in my career. Despite my dedicated efforts—single-handedly maintaining the activity module and contributing over 6 FTEs to the TW SSOPS project along with other initiatives, all with no escalations, and earning appreciation from the respective teams—I feel this might not be fully reflected in my compensation. While my peers at the same level typically handle a single component, I’ve gone above and beyond, working countless nights and weekends, even undergoing surgery due to prolonged sitting. However, my bonus, which was already on the lower side, has only increased by an additional MYR 10k.

Could we please schedule a time to discuss this at your convenience? I would deeply appreciate your insights and guidance on this matter.

Warm regards,Akash Sharma

This version maintains a highly polite and respectful tone, softens the language, and emphasizes gratitude while clearly conveying your concerns. Let me know if you’d like further refinements!

Dear Sahil,

I hope you’re doing well. Thank you for scheduling our call tomorrow to discuss my 2024 Year-End Review and for your recent email. I truly appreciate your leadership and the opportunity to review my performance and compensation.

To prepare effectively, I’d be grateful for your guidance on a few points:

	1.	Current Compensation and Market Positioning:You mentioned my salary of 127,650 MYR is 27.66% above the market median for Band 7, and I was hired above market median, but I haven’t received an increase in two years. I’m concerned this trend might continue, risking alignment with industry benchmarks. Could you kindly share the market data or criteria used to determine this positioning?
	2.	Potential 30% Increase (MYR 10k):Thank you for suggesting a 30% increase (MYR 10k) might be justifiable. I understand others in similar roles haven’t received this, so I’d respectfully ask how my case differs, based on criteria or metrics, while maintaining confidentiality.
	3.	Future Growth and Performance:Since I’m working on my next role, I’d love to discuss a career development plan and timelines for growth. I’d also appreciate feedback on my contributions to the TWSSOPS project, activity module, and other efforts, including how these might be recognized or supported.
	4.	Bonuses and Workload:Could we discuss the structure of bonuses or long-term incentives tied to my salary? I’m also managing significant responsibilities alone, so I’d kindly ask about potential support or resources.

I’m committed to aligning with the bank’s goals and look forward to our discussion. Please let me know if I can prepare anything else or adjust the timing. Thank you for your time and support

Dear Sahil,

I hope this message finds you well. I want to sincerely thank you for arranging our call tomorrow to discuss my 2024 Year-End Review and for the thoughtful insights you shared in your recent email. I truly value your leadership and the opportunity to review my performance and compensation with you.

To ensure I’m fully prepared and aligned with the bank’s goals, I’d greatly appreciate your guidance on a few points before our discussion. I’ve outlined my questions below, and I’m eager to hear your perspective on each:

	1.	Current Compensation and Market Positioning:You mentioned that my current salary of 127,650 MYR is 27.66% above the market median for my band (Band 7). I understand I was hired at a rate above the market median, but I’ve noticed I haven’t received a salary increase over the past two years. I’m concerned that this trend might continue into next year, potentially impacting my compensation relative to industry benchmarks. I’d love to better understand how my current compensation aligns with industry standards today and whether there’s any risk of falling below the market median in the future. Could you kindly share more about the market data or criteria used to determine this positioning? I’m eager to ensure I have a complete picture and would greatly appreciate your guidance on this.
	2.	Potential 30% Increase (MYR 10k):Thank you for noting that a 30% increase (MYR 10k) might be justifiable for my position—I’m deeply grateful for your consideration. However, I understand that others in similar roles or bands haven’t received increases of this magnitude. I’d respectfully like to ask how you arrived at this figure for me and what specific criteria, performance metrics, or market data distinguish my case from theirs, while maintaining confidentiality. If there are lower parameters or alternative considerations, I’d be thankful for your transparency on those as well.
	3.	Future Growth and Career Development:Since you mentioned I’m already working on what could be my next role, I’d kindly like to discuss my long-term growth within the bank. Could we explore a potential career development plan, including timelines for promotions or role changes, and the skills or achievements I should focus on? I’m committed to growing here and would value your advice on how I can best prepare for advancement.
	4.	Performance Feedback and Recognition of Efforts:I’m very thankful for the opportunity to contribute to the TWSSOPS project (contributing over 6 FTEs), maintain the activity module single-handedly, and support other initiatives, often working nights, weekends, and even while facing personal challenges like surgery due to prolonged sitting. I’d be grateful if we could discuss detailed feedback on my performance this year, particularly in these areas. Additionally, I’d appreciate your guidance on how these efforts might be reflected in my compensation, recognition, or support moving forward. I truly value being part of the team and want to ensure I’m on the right path.
	5.	Bonuses, Long-Term Incentives, and Workload Support:You noted that my bonus is tied to my salary, and I’d kindly like to ask if we could discuss the structure of bonuses or any long-term incentive plans that apply to my role. I’m also managing significant responsibilities on my own, and I’d respectfully inquire if there are opportunities to explore additional support or resources to ensure I can continue delivering high-quality work sustainably. I’d be grateful for your insights on these points.

I’m committed to aligning my efforts with the bank’s objectives and growing professionally, and I’m looking forward to our discussion. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can prepare for our call, and I’m more than happy to adjust the timing if needed. I truly appreciate your time, expertise, and support.
