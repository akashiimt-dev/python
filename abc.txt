am writing to formally bring to your attention serious concerns regarding the unprofessional and inappropriate behavior of my manager, [Manager’s Name], which I believe violates company policies and has created a toxic work environment. This conduct has caused me significant anxiety, emotional distress, and trauma, and I am seeking your immediate attention to address this matter.
Specifically, [Manager’s Name] has engaged in the following behaviors:
1.  Creating a Toxic Work Environment: [Briefly describe specific incidents, e.g., “My manager frequently uses derogatory language and belittles team members during meetings, fostering fear and discomfort.”]
2.  Humiliation in Front of Staff: [Provide details, e.g., “On [date], I was publicly humiliated in front of colleagues when [describe incident].”]
3.  Life Threats and Intimidation: [Detail the incident, e.g., “On [date], I received a direct threat from my manager stating [specific threat], which has left me feeling unsafe.”]
4.  Other Unprofessional Conduct: [Mention additional behaviors, e.g., favoritism, ignoring company protocols, or other policy violations.]
These actions not only undermine my ability to perform my duties effectively but also contravene the company’s commitment to a respectful and safe workplace. The ongoing stress and trauma caused by this behavior have significantly impacted my mental health and well-being.
I respectfully request that HR conduct a thorough, unbiased investigation into these matters and take strict disciplinary action against [Manager’s Name] in accordance with company policies. Additionally, I ask for measures to ensure a safe and supportive work environment moving forward, including protection from retaliation.
Please confirm receipt of this email and let me know the next steps in the process. I am happy to provide further details or documentation to support this complaint and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in person.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue. I trust that the company will handle this matter with the seriousness it deserves.
