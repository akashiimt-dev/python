ADO Story: Catalyst FileNet Testing - FileNet API Project Analysis and Reconfiguration
Title
Catalyst FileNet Testing: Filter FileNet API Projects, Analyze Payloads, Reconfigure, and Retest
Description
Filter all Catalyst projects using the FileNet API, analyze payloads including Kong token configurations starting from timeline 13176, reconfigure code as needed, and retest to ensure secure and functional API integrations.
Acceptance Criteria
	1	Project Filtering: Identify and list all projects using FileNet API with details on API usage.
	2	Payload Analysis: Retrieve and document payloads with Kong tokens from timeline 13176 onward.
	3	Kong Token Reconfiguration: Review and update Kong token handling for security and compliance.
	4	Code Analysis: Analyze code; implement changes if needed or justify no changes with evidence.
	5	Retesting: Test updated configurations, validate payloads, and document results.
	6	Documentation: Provide a report with findings, changes, test results, and timeline.
Tasks
	1	Filter projects using FileNet API.
	2	Extract and analyze payloads with Kong tokens.
	3	Review and reconfigure Kong token settings.
	4	Analyze and update FileNet API integration code.
	5	Retest APIs and validate functionality.
	6	Document findings and timeline.
Story Points
	•	Effort: 8 story points
Priority
	•	High
Timeline
	•	Start: Timeline 13176 (TBD: sprint/date)
	•	Duration: 4-6 weeks
	•	Milestones:
	◦	Week 1: Filter projects, extract payloads.
	◦	Week 2: Analyze payloads, tokens.
	◦	Week 3: Update code.
	◦	Week 4: Retest, document.
Notes
	•	Payloads: Expect HTTP requests with FileNet API calls and Kong tokens (e.g., Authorization headers).
	•	Reconfiguration: Update to dynamic Kong token retrieval if needed (e.g., OAuth2).
	•	Risks: Limited payload access or Kong configuration restrictions may delay progress.
Tags
	•	FileNet, Kong Gateway, Catalyst, Testing
Clarifications Needed
	•	Define timeline 13176 (sprint/date).
	•	Confirm payload storage location and access.
	•	Specify Kong token scope (FileNet-specific or shared).
