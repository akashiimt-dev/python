Our platform offers various support services and consists of both front-end and back-end components. The front end focuses on design, analytics, and frameworks like Node.js, while the back end uses GraphQL and open-source Sparkus. We’ve implemented a three-layer security model, ensuring you can’t directly call the process API from the web; instead, the experience layer retrieves the data securely.
