Subject: Confirmation Needed for Trade Case Generation Logic Implementation
Dear [Recipient’s Name],
I hope this email finds you well.
As per our recent discussion, we have identified a requirement to generate trade cases with specific client service codes: “BC” for Client Service and “TD” for Ops. It’s surprising that this was not caught during SIT/UAT, and I apologize for the oversight on our part.
To proceed, we plan to implement the following logic for trade case generation:
	•	For Client Service: If the business function is “Trade” and the department is “CSG,” the client service code should be set to “BC.”
	•	For Ops: The client service code should be set to “TD.”
This logic is critical as the password management process will depend on these client service codes. Before we proceed with the implementation, I would appreciate your confirmation on the above approach. Additionally, if there are any other considerations or adjustments needed, please let me know.
Once I receive your approval, we will implement the logic and ensure thorough testing to avoid any further surprises.
Looking forward to your response.

Please test the functionality for locking and unlocking in Activity. Let me explain how it works:
	1.	If there are 2-3 assignments or tasks, and any content is locked by another user, you will not be able to access it.
	2.	If you have two tasks (Task A and Task B) open in different windows, both can be accessed simultaneously. However, opening the same task in multiple windows is not allowed.
	3.	If you perform all actions through the button, the lock/unlock process happens automatically in the background.
	4.	If you open Task A and then close the entire browser, you will need to wait 15 minutes before reopening the same task. Currently, we have a 15-minute lock window, which may be extended later.
