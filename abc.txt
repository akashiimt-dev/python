Subject: Q3 Feedback & Summary of My Contributions

Hi Sahil,

I wanted to document my contributions for clear visibility and discussion, ensuring my efforts align with team and organizational goals.
	•	In UAT, I handled testing for all listed domains individually, even when other domains had dedicated team support.
	•	Beyond UAT, I actively contributed to SRs, CP bugs, and the development of common functionalities, ensuring smoother application performance.
	•	Developed Tranche 2 SSOPS SR and collaborated with Sugan and Arul, helping them with a ground-level understanding and knowledge sharing.
	•	Supported the implementation of a CR in RD Recon for Sheetal, ensuring successful integration.
	•	Assisted the TW team with RD, CSD Project Ghana, and worked on a major change for PAK Aasan Installment, which is pending file review.
	•	Worked as a Full Stack Developer, efficiently managing both frontend and backend responsibilities, whereas others in the same role focused individually on either frontend or backend.
	•	Took ownership of critical modules, ensuring high-quality deliveries while mentoring and supporting the team whenever required.
	•	Proactively identified gaps and potential improvements in the system, contributing to enhanced efficiency and performance.
	•	Always ready to collaborate, assist, and take on additional responsibilities, reinforcing a leadership mindset within the team.

I would also appreciate your input on any initiatives taken by other team members where I can contribute. Additionally, if you have any other feedback, including for Q3, please feel free to share.

Looking forward to your guidance on how I can further align myself for greater responsibilities and growth within the organization.

Best,
[Your Name]
