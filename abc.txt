Hi Raj,
Thank you for your email. I’ve outlined the work items I’m currently handling along with their percentage allocations and criticality levels based on ongoing priorities:
•  One Aasan installment change for Pak (HyperCare support): 20% - High criticality (Supporting HyperCare needs and aligning with the team for stability).
•  Banca CR implementation and monitoring: 15% - Moderate criticality (Implementing and monitoring as a template change, no major updates required).
•  Pega retail project engagement: 15% - Moderate criticality (Engaging with Vasu’s input and ongoing coordination).
•  File net catalyst change support: 15% - Moderate criticality (Supporting the change process with the team).
•  Process coordination and understanding for changes: 35% - High criticality (Requires time for coordination and understanding multiple processes).
These percentages may vary if my workload shifts, and I’m actively supporting all tasks to ensure smooth progress. Please let me know if you need further details or adjustments.
Regards,
Akash
