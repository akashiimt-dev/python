Below is a complete, polished, and professional narrative combining all the details you’ve shared about the incident with Sahil Bhandari, its ongoing impact, and the reasons you didn’t report earlier, crafted for your HR employee relations (ER) meeting. This narrative is structured to be clear, concise, and impactful, ensuring HR understands the severity of the situation and the need for action. It incorporates the June thirteen incident, Sahil’s pattern of behavior, the anonymous feedback incident, and the reasons for your hesitation to report, including your brief unprofessional response.

Statement for HR Employee Relations Meeting
On June thirteen, at approximately 6:45 PM, I entered the AC next room at our workplace and overheard my manager, Sahil Bhandari, and my colleague, Prince Mukhija, discussing their leave plans. When Prince asked about my leave plans, I explained that I intended to utilize my work-from-home option and block leave for fifteen days in late November, pending approval, in line with company policy. Abruptly, Sahil responded in Hindi, saying, “Tere baap ki company nahin hai,” which translates to, “This is not your father’s company,” in a dismissive and unprofessional tone.
I responded calmly, stating, “No problem, sir, I won’t take leave without your approval,” and added that the leave policy should be applied consistently across the team, as other colleagues have used similar arrangements. Sahil then escalated the situation, adopting a highly aggressive and intimidating tone that far exceeded professional boundaries. He used abusive language in Hindi, saying, “Bhosdi ke, jo karna hai vo kar le,” which roughly translates to, “Do whatever you want,” but includes highly offensive and derogatory terms inappropriate for the workplace. Under the mental stress of this confrontation, I regretfully responded unprofessionally, saying something like, “This isn’t fair,” which I acknowledge was inappropriate but was a reaction to his ongoing intimidation.
This incident was not isolated. Sahil has a history of using abusive and unprofessional language in the workplace, creating a hostile environment. I have written documentation, such as emails and chat messages, where Sahil has used inappropriate language, which I can provide to demonstrate this pattern. For example, in one instance, after I informed Sahil I would complete a task late at night, he responded the next day with abusive language, further illustrating his unprofessional conduct.
The impact of Sahil’s behavior has been significant. His disrespectful and abusive demeanor caused me considerable mental stress, which affected my focus and productivity. For instance, I typically fix multiple bugs daily, but after the June thirteen incident, on two or three occasions, I had to repeatedly message Sahil to assign bugs, as he was preoccupied discussing the incident with other team members. Just yesterday, my colleague Chandan asked me about the incident, indicating Sahil had discussed it with him. Additionally, Sahil sent a message to Prince Mukhija, which Prince showed me, saying in Hindi, “Dekh, to usi ke saath ja raha hai,” meaning, “Look, he’s hanging out with him,” referring to my interactions with coworkers during lunch. This intrusive monitoring made me feel targeted and uncomfortable, further straining my work environment.
I hesitated to report Sahil’s behavior earlier due to his close friendship with his manager, Satya, which fostered an intimidating atmosphere. Both Sahil and Satya frequently used inappropriate language in front of the team, discouraging complaints. For example, approximately one month ago, the bank requested anonymous feedback about our manager. One team member provided critical feedback, but within a few days, Sahil called a team meeting and shouted at everyone, saying things like, “Who thinks they can complain about me?” This felt retaliatory and reinforced my reluctance to come forward until now.
Sahil’s conduct, both on June thirteen and in prior instances, violates workplace policies and has created a hostile and unprofessional environment. I am requesting that HR investigate this incident, review Sahil’s pattern of behavior, examine the documentation I can provide, and take appropriate action to ensure a respectful and fair workplace for myself and my colleagues.

Analysis of the Narrative:
	•	Clarity and Structure: The statement is organized chronologically, starting with the June thirteen incident, followed by its impact, evidence of a pattern, reasons for delayed reporting, and a clear request for action. It avoids vague terms and maintains a neutral, professional tone.
	•	Key Points Covered: It includes Sahil’s abusive language (with translations), your unprofessional response (briefly, to maintain focus on Sahil), ongoing issues (bug assignments, monitoring), evidence (documents, Prince’s message), and the anonymous feedback incident to explain your hesitation.
	•	Professionalism: The narrative avoids slang, emotional outbursts, or overly personal details, ensuring HR focuses on Sahil’s conduct and its workplace impact.
	•	Action-Oriented: It clearly asks for an investigation and documentation review, aligning with typical ER expectations.
Confirmation: This is the correct way to present your story to HR. It’s comprehensive, professional, and positions your case strongly for action.
Tips for Delivering This in the Meeting:
	1	Practice: Rehearse this statement a few times to deliver it confidently without stumbling. If it’s too long to memorize, bring a printed copy or notecard with key points.
	2	Stay Calm: If HR interrupts with questions, pause, listen, and answer directly without getting defensive.
	3	Bring Evidence: Have copies of the emails or screenshots ready, organized, and labeled (e.g., “Email dated [date] showing abusive language”). Mention you have them but let HR request them formally.
	4	Handle Emotions: If you feel upset, take a deep breath and focus on facts, not feelings, to stay credible.
Potential HR Questions and Sample Answers: Since you wanted to prepare for HR’s questions, here are refined answers to the ones we practiced, plus a new one, to help you anticipate their probes:
	1	ER: How did Sahil’s behavior specifically impact your work performance or team interactions?
	◦	Answer: Sahil’s abusive language and intimidating tone caused significant mental stress, reducing my focus and productivity. For example, I struggled to engage confidently in team tasks, as I felt disrespected. His post-incident monitoring, like commenting on my lunch interactions, further disrupted my ability to collaborate comfortably.
	◦	Tip: Be specific but brief, focusing on work-related impacts.
	2	ER: Can you describe the written documentation of Sahil’s inappropriate language and how it shows a pattern?
	◦	Answer: I have emails and chat screenshots where Sahil used inappropriate language. For instance, in one email, after I said I’d complete a task late at night, he responded the next day with abusive remarks, similar to those on June thirteen. These documents, which I can provide, show a consistent pattern of unprofessional conduct.
	◦	Tip: Mention the documents’ existence without sharing unless asked, and clarify they’re available.
	3	ER: Can you clarify what you said in your unprofessional response on June thirteen, and how the situation unfolded afterward?
	◦	Answer: Under the stress of Sahil’s abusive remarks, I said something like, “This isn’t fair,” which I regret as unprofessional. The situation de-escalated afterward, as I left the room to avoid further conflict. My response was a reaction to his ongoing intimidation, but I acknowledge it wasn’t appropriate.
	◦	Tip: Own the mistake briefly and pivot back to Sahil’s behavior to keep the focus on him.
	4	ER: You mentioned Sahil shouted at the team after anonymous feedback. When did this happen, and what did he say?
	◦	Answer: About a month ago, the bank requested anonymous feedback about our manager. A team member provided critical input, and within days, Sahil called a team meeting where he shouted, saying things like, “Who thinks they can complain about me?” This felt retaliatory and discouraged me from reporting earlier.
	◦	Tip: Stick to approximate timelines and direct quotes if possible to strengthen credibility.
	5	ER: Was anyone else present during the June thirteen incident who can corroborate your account? (New question)
	◦	Answer: Yes, my colleague Prince Mukhija was present and heard Sahil’s remarks. I haven’t discussed this formally with him, but he was in the room during the entire conversation.
	◦	Tip: Be honest about Prince’s involvement and avoid assuming he’ll back you up unless you’ve confirmed with him.
Mock Interview Feedback (from our session):
	•	Strengths: You provided critical details, like the specific Hindi phrases Sahil used, the message to Prince, and the anonymous feedback incident, which show a pattern and context. Mentioning Chandan’s conversation and written evidence strengthens your case. Your honesty about your unprofessional response builds credibility.
	•	Areas for Improvement: Some responses were vague (e.g., “these kind of feelings” or “scratch our ass”), which could confuse HR or seem unprofessional. You occasionally skipped parts of questions, like the anonymous feedback details, which HR might notice. Practice staying concise and addressing all parts of a question directly.
	•	Overall Performance: You’re on a solid path, but clarity and structure need work. With the polished narrative above and practiced answers, you’ll come across as credible and prepared. Focus on delivering facts calmly and avoiding tangents about feelings or unrelated issues (e.g., “same band” coding tasks).
Next Steps:
	•	Practice Delivery: Read the narrative aloud a few times to get comfortable. If you want, we can do another mock interview to refine your delivery or test more questions.
	•	Prepare Evidence: Organize your documents (e.g., emails, screenshots) in a folder, ideally with dates and brief notes on what they show, but don’t present them unless HR asks.
	•	Anticipate Pushback: HR might ask if you provoked Sahil or why you didn’t de-escalate. Stay calm and reiterate that his behavior was unprovoked and inappropriate.
Is there anything specific you’re still worried about for tomorrow’s meeting, like a particular question, handling nerves, or presenting the documents? Or do you want to rehearse the full narrative or specific answers again?
