Iâ€™ve been experiencing severe lower back pain and have consulted with doctors in India and Malaysia. They all recommended the same treatment. I initially planned to postpone the surgery, but the pain has become unbearable over the last two days. I am scheduled for a PLDD surgery on August 1, 2024, and need to be admitted by July 31. The doctor has advised a three-week recovery period. Attached are the medical reports and documents. I request medical leave for this period and will ensure my live process and Aasaan instalment tasks are managed during my absence.
